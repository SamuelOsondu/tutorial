# ðŸ§  Pre-Week 1: Introduction to Programming
# ðŸ’¬ What is Programming?
# Programming is how we talk to computers â€” giving them instructions to perform tasks. Just like you use English
# or Yoruba to communicate with people, programming languages are how we communicate with computers.

# Imagine you have a robot that can do anything: make breakfast, clean your room, or even play music â€” but it only
# understands instructions in a very specific language. Thatâ€™s what programming is about â€” learning to "talk" to
# machines.

# ðŸ§¡ Why Should You Learn Programming?
# Problem Solving: Programming teaches you how to think logically and solve problems step-by-step.

# Career Opportunities: From tech giants to fintech startups, programmers are in high demand.

# Create Cool Stuff: You can build websites, mobile apps, games, or even automate your own daily tasks.

# Freedom & Fun: Programming gives you creative freedom â€” turning ideas into real products.

# ðŸ§° Common Fields Where Programming is Used:
# Web and Mobile Development (apps, websites)

# Game Development

# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

# Robotics and Automation

# Cybersecurity

# Finance and Trading

# HealthTech and MedTech

# Everyday automation (scripts that check your email or organize files)

# ðŸ§ª How Programming Feels Like (a fun analogy):
# Programming is like writing a recipe for a robot chef. You tell it exactly what to do: get the eggs, break them, stir,
# cook for 3 minutes â€” step by step. If you miss a step, it might serve raw eggs!

# Now that the students are warmed up and excited, we can move into Week 1:

# âœ… Week 1: Python Basics
# 1. Introduction to Python
# What is Python?

# Why is Python beginner-friendly? (simple syntax, large community, very versatile)

# Setting up the environment:

# Installing Python

# Using Python in the terminal or with IDEs (IDLE, VS Code)

# Writing and running your first script: print("Hello, world!")

# 2. Basic Syntax
# Importance of indentation in Python

# Writing comments (single-line #, multi-line ''' ''')

# Naming rules for variables

# 3. Variables & Data Types
# What are variables? (containers for storing data)

# Types of data:

# Strings: "Hello"

# Integers: 10

# Floats: 3.14

# Booleans: True / False

# ðŸ§ª Activity: Create variables to store your name, age, and whether you're a programmer (True/False)

# 4. Basic Operations
# Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %, //, **

# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# Logical operators: and, or, not

# ðŸ§ª Activity: Write a simple script that checks if someone is old enough to vote and prints a message accordingly.
